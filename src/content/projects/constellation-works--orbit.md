Orbit is a local-first runtime for coding agents. Keep using your authenticated agent CLI; Orbit adds a durable task queue, sandboxed worktrees, file locks for parallel runs, a gated delivery pipeline, and an audit log.

**Why:** fast agents make planning, review, and traceability easy to lose. Orbit keeps the prompt, plan, and review behind every change, with a task ID on every workflow commit.

- **Single binary, no cloud.** State lives in `~/.orbit` and `.orbit/`; Orbit sends no telemetry.
- **Bring your own agents.** Use the provider CLIs you already have authenticated, without giving Orbit API keys.
- **MIT licensed.** No paid tier or hosted offering.

## How it works

```text
You:    The fsProfile lookup is undocumented. Get that fixed.
Agent:  Files a proposed task with acceptance criteria. Approve it and ship?
You:    Yes.
Agent:  Queues it, then runs plan → execute → review in a locked, isolated worktree.
        Opens a pull request. Review and merge it, then approve the task to close it.
```

Nothing starts without approval; PR runs stop for your review unless you authorize `--complete`. The task record keeps the prompt, plan, execution trace, and review. For larger…
