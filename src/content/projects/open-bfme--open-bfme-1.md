# BFME 1 Source Code

Goal: rebuild BFME 1's retail executable byte for byte from source, and use that source to fix and improve the game.

[Join our Discord to participate!](https://discord.gg/wCvA2XqPUT)

## What?

* We rewrite the game's code as C++, one small piece at a time.
* Each piece must rebuild to the exact bytes of the original game exe (BFME 1, version 1.03).
* When every piece matches and links, the whole game is open source, and we can fix bugs and make mods.

### What the bars measure

* **Rebuilt from source**: code rebuilding to the original exe's exact bytes, partly generated code or prebuilt libraries.
* **Game code in C++**: the game's own code (no libraries) in C++.
* **Linking**: the part of that code in files that link cleanly (link census).

## Status

Source: `game/` and `worldbuilder/`, with their ledgers in `targets/`. Original
binaries, toolchains and references: `inputs/`. Mods: `mods/`.
