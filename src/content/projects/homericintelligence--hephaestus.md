# Hephaestus

Shared utilities and tooling for the HomericIntelligence ecosystem, powered by [uv](https://uv.sh) for environment management.

## Overview

Hephaestus provides standardized utility functions and tools that can be shared across all HomericIntelligence repositories. Following the principles in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/Hephaestus/blob/HEAD/AGENTS.md), this project emphasizes:

- **Modularity**: Well-defined, reusable components
- **Simplicity**: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
- **Consistency**: Standardized interfaces and patterns
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing and error handling

**Project Status:** See [docs/ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/HomericIntelligence/Hephaestus/blob/HEAD/docs/ROADMAP.md) for the public roadmap and current focus areas.

## Installation

### From PyPI

Hephaestus is published to PyPI under the ecosystem-branded distribution name **`HomericIntelligence-Hephaestus`**. The import name, however, is the short lowercase `hephaestus`:

```bash
pip install HomericIntelligence-Hephaestus
```

```python
import hephaestus

print(hephaestus.__version__)
```
