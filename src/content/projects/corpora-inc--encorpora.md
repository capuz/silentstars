# encorpora

**encorpora** (“on corpora”) is Corpora Inc’s monorepo. Products, packs, content,
infrastructure and the marketing site all live here and ship from one trunk.

squash-merge to `main`. See [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/corpora-inc/encorpora/blob/HEAD/AGENTS.md) for the worker loop and the gates.

- **Corpán Packs** (`corpan/packs/`) — the pack system and the packs themselves:
  games, readers, an on-device LLM tutor, a multiplayer city. Packs deploy
  over-the-air on merge to `main` and are versioned against app floors.
- **Dynawalla: Apprentice of Numbers** (`dynawalla/`, planned — not yet on `main`)
  — the newest product: children's mathematics, grades 1–6 plus an introduction
  to pre-algebra, set in an ancient-futurist world of astrolabes, gears and
  mechanical computers.
- **Books & publishing** (`books/`) — the authored source for…
