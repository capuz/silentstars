# 🛡️ VPN Config Security Filter

## 🚀 What's new in v6.0

The main change: **every link is now actually parsed**, rather than checked with regexes against the raw string. Percent-encoding is decoded, `&amp;` and `\u0026` are repaired, and parameter synonyms are reduced to a single name. Everything that previously passed as "unreadable — therefore fine" is now rejected.

### 🔬 Parsing and normalization

- ✅ **URI parser instead of regex** — vless / vmess / trojan / hysteria2 / ss / tuic are parsed into a structure
- ✅ **Double decoding** — `&amp;amp;`, `\u0026`, `%5Cu0026`, `¬`
- ✅ **Invisible characters** — zero-width, BOM, `\n`, control chars are stripped before checking
- ✅ **Parameter synonyms** — `allowlnsecure` (with a lowercase L), `skip-cert-verify`, `skip_cert_verify`, `insecure`
- ✅ **Lowercase scheme** — `VLESS://` no longer breaks parsing
- ✅ **Insecurity flags** — any value other than an explicit `0/false/no/off` is treated as enabled
- ✅ **vmess `"tls":"none"`** — no longer passes as valid TLS
- ✅ **Duplicates before limits** — one node with different names no longer pushes out legitimate configs

### 🌐 Addresses and protocols

- ✅ **`ipaddress` instead of…
